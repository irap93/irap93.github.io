      <description>Lending a helping hand to fellow grad students is perhaps the most rewarding and enjoyable educational activities which graduate students can partake in. Benefits are two-fold. First, you gain the satisfactory feeling that comes from helping out a fellow student and friend while secondly, learning something more about a part of science and nature which heretofore you knew absolutely nothing about. And all at zero cost, no stress, and potentially some good food and comradeship.</description>
