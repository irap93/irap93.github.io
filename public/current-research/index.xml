      <description>Body weight is a critical component for monitoring animal body mass, body condition, nutritional status, and health. However, traditional methods of collecting body weight are stressful, costly, and logistically impractical with cattle on extensive landscapes. Remote systems capable of collecting individual animal body weight provide a potential solution, but automatic systems may collect spurious measurements. The objectives of this study were to 1) describe the utility of using a remote weight capture system, 2) develop methods for identifying and removing spurious measurements, and 3) cross-validate automatically collected weights with static chute collected weights.</description>

      <description>Examining the relationship between sampling strategy, density, and map interpolation accuracy
Obtaining accurate and precise maps of landscape features often requires intensive spatial sampling and interpolation. The data required to generate reliable interpolated maps varies with sampling density and landscape heterogeneity. However, there has been no rigorous examination of sampling density relative to landscape characteristics and interpolation methods. Our objective was to characterize the 3-way relationship among sampling density, interpolation method, and landscape heterogeneity on interpolation accuracy and precision in simulated and in situ landscapes.</description>
