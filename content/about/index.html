<p>Ira is a graduate research assistant in the department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Aquaculture at Mississippi State University. Growing up on the family farm in Northeast Kansas, Ira developed a love for animals, the outdoors, and nature. He received his bachelors in Feed Science and Management from Kansas State University in 2015 before moving to Texas A&amp;M where he completed a Masters of Science in Animal Science with a concentration in Ruminant Nutrition. With a focus on improving management of natural resources, Ira is pursuing his passion, exploring the nexus between plant and animal ecology to maximize efficiency and sustainability for livestock production. Through research and improving scientists understanding of grazing, movement, and forage ecology, Ira hopes to generate excitement for science while providing tools to land and resource managers to farther improve environmental stewardship, wildlife management, agricultural production, and economic profitability.</p>
